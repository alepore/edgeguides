# Image processing

## Architecture overview

In a typical Solidus store, you can upload images for products and taxons.

Under the hood, Solidus will use a different file processing library depending on the Rails
version: [Active Storage](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html) is the
default starting from Rails 6.1,
while [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip#paperclip) is used in earlier versions.

:::caution

Active Storage cannot be used in Rails 6.0 or earlier because it doesn't support public URLs, which
Solidus needs to serve images to your users. If you're on Rails 6.0 or earlier, you _have_ to use
Paperclip.

:::

While Paperclip is deprecated and will be removed in the near future, Solidus provides a
compatibility layer that abstracts the differences between the two libraries, in order to offer an
easier migration path to existing Paperclip users.

## Customizing image sizes

By default, Solidus uses the following sizes for images:

* `mini`: 48x48
* `small`: 400x400
* `product`: 680x680
* `large`: 1200x1200

You can access the URL for a specific sizes by calling, e.g. `Spree::Image#url`:

```ruby
image = Spree::Image.first
image.url(:product)
```

If you're building a custom storefront, you may also want to change the sizes of the images in your
store. You can do this by applying an override to `Spree::Image`:

```ruby title="app/overrides/amazing\_store/spree/image/customize\_sizes.rb"
module AmazingStore
  module Spree
    module Image
      module CustomizeSizes
        def self.prepended(klass)
          klass.attachment_definitions[:attachment][:styles] = {
            mini: '48x48>',
            small: '400x400>',
            product: '680x680>',
            large: '1200x1200>',
            jumbo: '1600x1600>'
          }
        end

        ::Spree::Image.prepend self
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Now that you changed your sizes, try getting the URL for your new `jumbo` size or `large` sizes:

```ruby
image = Spree::Image.first
image.url(:jumbo)
taxon = Spree::Taxon.first
taxon.url(:large)
```

Solidus will generate the new sizes and return their URLs!

You can also use your new styles in the `image` partial:

```ruby
< %= render 'spree/admin/shared/image', image: product.gallery.images.first, size: :jumbo %>
```

## Customizing the allowed MIME types

By default, Solidus only accepts PNG, JPEG and GIF images. If you want to accept additional MIME
types, e.g. WebP, you can do it via the `allowed_image_mime_types` configuration option:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...

  config.allowed_image_mime_types = %w(image/jpeg image/jpg image/png image/gif image/webp).freeze
end
```

## Replacing an attachment module

If the change you want to apply cannot be made through the existing configuration options, you can
entirely replace the product image or taxon icon attachment module with your own.

This can be useful, for example, if you need to customize your image styles or perform custom
post-processing operations on your image such as watermarking, compression, etc.

:::info

When replacing an attachment module, we recommend copy-pasting the original module first and only
changing what you need. The right starting point will depend on whether you're using ActiveStorage
or Paperclip. You can find the modules
for `Spree::Image` [here](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/tree/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/image)
and the modules
for `Spree::Taxon` [here](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/tree/v3.0/core/app/models/spree/taxon).

:::

Here's an example for the product image attachment:

```ruby title="app/models/amazing\_store/image\_attachment.rb"
module AmazingStore
  module ImageAttachment
    # ...
  end
end
```

Once you have your custom attachment module, you need to tell Solidus to use it:

```ruby title="config/initializers/spree.rb"
Spree.config do |config|
  # ...
  config.image_attachment_module = 'AmazingStore::ImageAttachment'
end
```

To replace the taxon attachment, follow the same process, but set the `taxon_attachment_module`
configuration option instead.
